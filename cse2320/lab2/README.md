You are an event manager who has two equal ballrooms which host events. You are
given a list of event bids (which includes the event's start/end times and the
amount that the event is worth) and wish to come up with the optimal layout for
the events, which will make you the most money.

The algorithm is implemented using Dynamic Programming and is bounded by n^2.
