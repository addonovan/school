To run with console input:

  $ make run

Then enter in the text of the file.

You can also redirect an input file if you want

  $ make run < path/to/file.txt
  or 
  $ cat path/to/file.txt | make run

Alternatively, to test the sample files provided, you can just run

  $ make samples

Which will then download them all to the samples directory directory, then run
`test.sh` with each file, which will execute `cat samples/<file>.in | ./main.o` 
and compare the output from that command with the corresponding `<file>.out`.
