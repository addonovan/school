CSE 2320 Lab #1
===

The purpose of this lab was rather simple. Given a list of intervals (whose
bounds may be either inclusive or exclusive, or a combination), perform a
mergesort and combine any adjacent intervals encountered while sorting.

For example:
`(1, 2)` and `[2, 5]` would be combined to become `(1, 5]`


You can see the full list of test cases (with the bounds tests illustrated with
comments) in the `test/interval.c` file.
