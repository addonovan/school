CSE 2320: Algorithms and Data Structures
===

Professor: [Bob Weems](http://ranger.uta.edu/~weems/)

> Design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on data structures. 
> Approaches to analyzing lower bounds on problems and upper bounds on 
> algorithms. Classical algorithm design techniques including algorithms for 
> sorting, searching, and other operations on data structures such as hash 
> tables, trees, graphs, strings, and advanced data structures, dynamic 
> programming and greedy approaches.

This course was taught entirely in C and I developed a few tricks over the
semester so I didn't have to write `->` anywhere. Starting in lab2, I begin to 
use `$` as a macro expanding to `(*this)`, so I could write `$.something` 
instead of `this->something`. Just so's ya knows.
