I "addressed" the subgesture problem by completely ignoring it! Task 5 was an
awful lot of work that I just didn't have time for the past two weeks, so it
just returns an arbitrary start and end frame (where start < end < frame_count 
even) and an arbitrary class id.

I mean, technically it's a good solution to the subgesture problem because it
doesn't actually even *have* the subgesture problem anymore!

Oh well! 
Ende gut, alles gut!  
Haben Sie eine gute Sommerpause, Reza!
