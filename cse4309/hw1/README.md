Naive Bayes Classifier
===

This homework assignment implements a very basic naive bayesian classifier
(which isn't necessarily great for a real-world classification algorithm)
to classify datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Datasets.

There is a problem in here somewhere that I couldn't find before I turned
it in. If you can find it, then, by all means, let me know.
