Professor: [Vassilis Athitsos](http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/)

>This course offers an introduction to machine learning. Topics include naive 
>Bayes classifiers, linear regression, linear classificiers, neural networks 
>and backpropagation, kernel methods, decision trees, feature selection, 
>clustering, and reinforcement learning. A strong programming background is 
>assumed, as well as familiarity with linear algebra (vector and matrix 
>operations), and knowledge of basic probability theory and statistics
